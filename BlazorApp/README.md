# CoViDAccountant

This project has been developed for my Master's thesis in Computer Science.  
The project is built using Microsoft's **Blazor** framework for the frontend
and employs **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM layer for data access.

Its main use case is the registration of covid-tests' results,
that are executed by a dynamic set of diagnostic centers located in a dynamic set of cities.

Supported User **Roles**
Admin - Setup of users that can login along with their roles
Doctor - Registration of covid tests results
